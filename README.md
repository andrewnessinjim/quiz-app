# Quiz App

As suggested by Josh in [his amazing course](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react), I am building this app for unguided practice where I can apply the concepts learnt in the course. Here are a few concepts that I applied:

1. Used the producer-consumer pattern to come up with easy-to-understand component APIs.
2. Used the spectrum of components idea to redesign a component so it occupies a single spot on the spectrum.
3. Used framer motion for realistic animations.
4. Used RadixUI to build accessible toggle button, progress bar and a radio group.

## Deployed App
You can check the deployed version of the app here: https://t67tlv-3000.csb.app/

This is part of a codesandbox workspace: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/andrewnessinjim/quiz-app/main?workspaceId=1b98656d-ba4b-426f-921e-5c9a62f55a7d

## Road Map
Here are a few things I would like to learn using this project:

1. Apply consistent animations throughout the app to make it more cohesive.
3. Use NextJS to support multiple quizzes and a leaderboard. (NextJS is part of the same course)
3. Integrate Firebase for data persistence. (Firebase is not part of the same course)
4. Include unit test cases and Cypress end-to-end tests.
